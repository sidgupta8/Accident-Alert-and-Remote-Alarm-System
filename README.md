# Accident-Alert-and-Remote-Alarm-System
ðŸ‘‰When 2 or more vehicles are in close proximity with each other or met with an accident than the system gets activated.
ðŸ‘‰This system consists of two main parts. The first part detects whether the vehicle has fallen down or met with any impact or any fire accident has taken place. This module consist of three sensors namely, Piezoelectric sensor transducer, MEMS, Smoke sensor. Once the vehicle accident is detected the information is send to the second part of the system. The second part consists of an Arduino uno, GSM module, GPS module. When any of the three sensors gets activated based on the level of impact then the micro-controller Atmega in the Arduino fetches the location from the GPS receiver and sends the corresponding information to the contact number mentioned in the code which is dumbed in the Arduino i.e., to near and dear oneâ€™s via SMS.
